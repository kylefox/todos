We just finished a logical unit of work. It's time to update documentation and commit the changes.

- Analyze your recent chat history, context, and uncommitted changes.
- Update the project and memory files accordingly.
  - Review @CLAUDE.md for rules about managing these files.
  - Update @PROJECT_ROADMAP.MD, current phase (ex: @PHASE_1.md), and @CHANGELOG.md
  - If needed, updated @README.md and @CLAUDE.md
- Write a short & sweet commit summary
- Write a more detailed but not overly verbose commit description
- Commit the changes to git.
